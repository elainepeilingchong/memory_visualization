# Memory Visualization

This is a project for the Operating System Module which helps the student to visualize the memory management in operating system.

This project will perform address translation and use translation-lookaside buffer for faster translation. It will handle the exception (Page fault) when the memory is saved in disk. 

# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

## Prerequisites
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or any other virtual machines.
<br /> 
[Ubuntu 18.04.](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?country=IE&version=18.04.2&architecture=amd64)

Give examples
##Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running


```bash
make
```
Give the example
And repeat

until finished
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
